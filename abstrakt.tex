In this thesis, I explore the topic of the conversion between first-person and third-person narratives. The aim is to create a tool that converts texts between the two narratives. I summarize the basics of narrative theory and the syntactic structures that distinguish the first and third person. Based on this overview, I propose a set of rules to perform the conversion, describe the implemented tool, and evaluate the quality of the results achieved.
