The aim of this thesis was to explore the topic of person transfer and implement a tool that will transfer texts between the first-person and third-person narratives.
To achieve these goals, I have compiled an overview of the topic from the perspective of literary theory and Czech grammar. Based on this information, I proposed several rules for conversion in both directions. Subsequently, I implemented these rules in the RephrasErIch tool I created. Finally, I evaluated the tool's results on a set of textual data.
