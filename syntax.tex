\section{Verb and its Person in Czech sentence}

\paragraph{Present indicative}

\paragraph{Future indicative}

\paragraph{Passive voice}

\paragraph{Past tense} exists only in compound form in the Czech language. The compound tense is made up of an auxiliary verb and a participle.

The auxiliary verb is a verb \emph{být (to be)}, and it agrees in person and number with a subject.

The second part of the combination is a past participle, and it carries the meaning. This part agrees in gender and number with a subject.

Nevertheless, the auxiliary verb is not used in the third person.

I show an example of conjugation of verb \emph{psát (write)} in Table \ref{tab:past-tense-conj}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
	\caption{Past tense conjugation in Czech}
	\label{tab:past-tense-conj}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{l|r|r}
			person & singular & plural \\
			\hline
			First & já \textbf{jsem} psal (\emph{I wrote}) & my \textbf{jsme} psali (\emph{we wrote}) \\
			Second & ty \textbf{jsi} psal (\emph{you wrote}) & vy \textbf{jste} psali (\emph{you wrote})  \\
			Third & on psal (\emph{he wrote}) & oni psali (\emph{they wrote})  \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Conditional Mood} is constructed similarly to the past tense. The difference is the auxiliary verb. The conditional mood is composed of \emph{conditional auxiliar} and a participle. Unlike the past tense, the auxiliar is expressed even in the third person.

An example is in Table \ref{tab:cond}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
	\caption{Conditional mood conjugation in Czech}
	\label{tab:cond}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{l|r|r}
			person & singular & plural \\
			\hline
			First & já \textbf{bych} psal (\emph{I would write}) & my \textbf{bychom} psali (\emph{we ...}) \\
			Second & ty \textbf{bys} psal (\emph{you would write}) & vy \textbf{byste} psali (\emph{you ...})  \\
			Third & on \textbf{by} psal (\emph{he would write}) & oni \textbf{by} psali (\emph{they ...})  \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Special Conjunctions}

By special conjunction, I mean conjunction that changes its form based on the person it refers to. This includes conjunctions \emph{aby} and \emph{kdyby}. The forms are conjugated like the conditional auxiliars.
