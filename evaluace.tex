\section{Evaluation Corpus}

For evaluation, I have constructed my own text corpus. The corpus is composed of texts written by contemporary Czech authors who provided the texts themselves. The corpus is intentionally small as humans did the evaluation, and evaluating a large set of sentences would be expensive.

In selecting the texts, I tried to capture various characteristics of the texts. Thus, the corpus consists of several different literary genres; the narrators are both male and female; I have included texts written in the present and past tense, and I have chosen texts containing different types of speech. (Such as direct speech, semi-direct speech...) Finally, the corpus, of course, includes both first-person and third-person narratives.

In total, the evaluation data consists of 36 different texts composed of 388 sentences. The numbers divided by narratives are captured in chart \ref{fig:eval-input-numbers}.

\section{Annotation Process}

As mentioned in the previous section, human annotators evaluated the sentences manually. The annotators have got: the person the text is converted from, the name of the protagonist, the original text, and the rephrased text. After reading the texts, an annotator could mark one or more statements for each sentence as true.

The possible statements to mark:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The sentence is converted correctly, without grammatical errors, sounds natural, and is unambiguous.
	\item The sentence has lost its unambiguity.
	\item The word order is unnatural, or there are other unnatural sounding elements in the sentence.
	\item The sentence contains grammatical errors.
	\item Some parts of the sentence are converted correctly, and some are not.
	\item The sentence is not converted correctly or not converted at all.
	\item The sentence has not been converted, and that is correct.
\end{itemize}

The evaluation's non-binarity also offers a basic error analysis, which gives us a basis for discussion about the quality of generated texts.

\section{Results}

Based on the marking, I retrieved the results statistics.

As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:eval-total}, most of the sentences were converted correctly, which also includes not converting the sentence at all (about 66\%). Only 17\% of the 388 sentences were converted incorrectly, partially, or entirely. The remaining 17\% are sentences that were converted correctly. However, the conversion damaged the text's quality (naturality of expression, unambiguity, or grammar).

Now let us take a look at the results for each narrative mode.

\subsection{First-person to Third-person results}

Figure \ref{fig:eval-first-to-third} shows very good results for the first-person narrative to third-person narrative conversion. Less than 5\% of the sentences were converted partially or completely incorrectly. Moreover, about 82\% of the remaining sentences were converted (or not converted) without any quality loss. The most common problem was unnatural word order.

\subsection{Third-person to First-person results}
On the other hand, figure \ref{fig:eval-third-to-first} illustrates quite a different picture. The third-to-first conversion direction delivers poor performance results. Notice that the number of completely incorrect sentences is very high (more than 25\%) even when considering the fact that 68 sentences were not affected by the conversion at all.
