First of all, I would like to thank my advisor Zuzana Nevěřilová for helping me discover a suitable topic when I thought it was completely hopeless, for her willingness to help me, and many valuable comments on the whole thesis. I also thank all the external evaluators and authors who provided their texts.

Warm thanks to my family for their lifelong support, my friends for keeping me sane, the penguins and Paštika for the daily laugh, and Schola Artist for the opportunity to hang upside down and fly away from everything on aerial silks.

Finally, I cannot put into words my gratitude to Honza Horáček for his undying support, love, care, and unimaginable tolerance. I am grateful to have converted this person into my person.
